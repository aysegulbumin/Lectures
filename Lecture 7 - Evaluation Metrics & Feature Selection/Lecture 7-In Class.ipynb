    "* So far, we have focused on regression. We will begin to discuss classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The goal in **classification** is to take an input vector, **X**, and assign it to one of $K$ discrete classes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Usually this is done by learning **decision boundaries** or **decision surfaces** that divide up the feature space and assign a class to each partition of the feature space created by the decision boundary. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Data whose classes can be separated perfectly with a linear decision surface (i.e., a line in 2-D, a plane in 3-D, etc) are called **linearly separable**. These are the easiest classification problems to address. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * There are *many* classifiers in the machine learning literature. We will cover a few in this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can **encode class labels** in a number of ways: binary vectors, class number, etc. Different encodings make sense in different situations. But you want to select carefully - depending on the algorithm you use, it can make a difference. "

    "# Typical Workflow of a Supervised Learning System\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Acquisition**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most (if not the one) crucial steps in building a supervised learning system. The collected data will have a tremendous impact on the subsequent steps of the machine learning system including: feature extraction, model selection and model validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Extraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the data you are working with was already collected and features were extracted, so you will have little control of the first two steps, other than some feature engineering you may wish to apply.\n",
    "When you do have control of your data, feature extraction will also be an important step. We will discuss more details on this broad topic, specifically for image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pre-processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this stage you will prepare the data to be *fed* into the system. Data pre-processing include **normalization**. This can be a big difference in the results. Always normalize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the model can be influenced by any information you may have about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step you will be mostly trying to find the set of parameters that fit the data the best but avoid overfitting. This includes implementing strategies such as: regularization, k-fold cross-validation and plotting learning curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are useful modules from the ```scikit-learn``` library that you should take some time reading and learning about: from the module ```preprocessing```, read about function ```StandardScaler```; from the module ```cross_validation```, read about function ```cross_val_score```; from module ```learning_curve```, read about function ```learning_curve```; from module ```grid_search```, read about function ```GridSearchCV```. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step of a supervised learning system is to report on the model's performance. This may include any statistical measures such as: mean average error, Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plot and hypothesis tests. If you want to answer the question \"Is A a more accurate algorithm than B?\", this becomes the hypothesis \"Can we say that the average error of learners trained by A is significantly lower than the average error of learners trained by B?\". So we can design statistical tests and measures to evaluate the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you can also look at different performance metrics. This next section will discuss different performance metrics."

    "\n",
    "* Classification accuracy is the most common evaluation metric for classification problems, it is also the most misused. It is really only suitable when there are an equal number of observations in each class (which is rarely the case) and that all predictions and prediction errors are equally important, which is often not the case.\n",

    "\n",
    "An alternative way to reduce the complexity of the model and avoid overfitting is dimensionality reduction via feature selection, which is especially useful for unregularized models. There are two main categories of dimensionality reduction techniques: feature selection and feature extraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Using feature selection, we select a subset of the original features. \n",
    "* In feature extraction, we derive information from the feature set to construct a new feature subspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential feature selection algorithms are a family of greedy search algorithms that are used to reduce an initial $d$-dimensional feature space to a $k$-dimensional feature subspace where $k<d$. The motivation behind feature selection algorithms is to automatically select a subset of features that are most relevant to the problem to improve computational efficiency or reduce the generalization error of the model by removing irrelevant features or noise, which can be useful for algorithms that don't support regularization. \n",
    "\n",
    "A classic sequential feature selection algorithm is **Sequential Backward Selection (SBS)**, which aims to reduce the dimensionality of the initial feature subspace with a minimum decay in performance of the classifier to improve upon computational efficiency. In certain cases, SBS can even improve the predictive power of the model if a model suffers from overfitting."

    "The idea behind the SBS algorithm is quite simple: SBS sequentially removes features from the full feature subset until the new feature subspace contains the desired number of features. In order to determine which feature is to be removed at each stage, we need to define criterion function $J$ that we want to minimize. The criterion calculated by the criterion function can simply be the difference in performance of the classifier after and before the removal of a particular feature. Then the feature to be removed at each stage can simply be defined as the feature that maximizes this criterion; or, in more intuitive terms, at each stage we eliminate the feature that causes the least performance loss after removal. Based on the preceding definition of SBS, we can outline the algorithm in 4 simple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the algorithm with $k=d$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the full feature space $\\mathbf{X}_d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Determine the feature $x^-$ that maximizes the criterion $x^- = \\arg\\max J(\\mathbf{X}_k - x^-)$ where $x \\in \\mathbf{X}_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Remove the feature $x^-$ from the feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Terminate if $k$ equals the number of desired features, if not, go to step 2."
