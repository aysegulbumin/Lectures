    "## Step 3: Command-Line Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've got the hang of git, it's time to get more practice with the command-line! For this step, you'll practice with some basic file shell utilities, and will need to save your command-line session to a file. The easiest way to do this is to simply copy-and-paste the terminal contents into a `practice-session.txt` file saved in your assignment repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "On a Mac or Linux, it is also possible to record a shell session using the [script](https://man.cx/script) utility (e.g., script `practice-session.txt`). Then you just work with the shell as normal, using the exit command to stop recording when finished.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "From the command-line, you should perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Display the current [working directory](https://man.cx/pwd). If the current directory is not your repo, use `cd` to change to it and then display the current working directory again to demonstrate that you're in the right place.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Display](https://man.cx/echo) your computer's `PATH` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "The `PATH` is a system-level environmental variable that keeps a list of directories where command-line programs and utilities may be found, so that the command shell knows where to look for the program to run. So if you tell the shell to run the `git` command (e.g., with `git status`), the shell will look for an executable file called `git` on each directory listed in the path, in order. Effectively, this acts as a set of \"shortcuts\" instead of needing to specify the full location of the program to run.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Variables* in Bash are written with a leading `$`. So if you had a variable called `HOME_DIR`, you would refer to it as `$HOME_DIR` (e.g., in `cd $HOME_DIR`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [Display](https://man.cx/cat) the contents of the hidden `.gitignore` file in the repo's \"root\" directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A [`.gitignore`](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/ignoring-files) file is used to tell git to \"ignore\" certain files and never commit them. It contains a list of files and folders to ignore.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Using the command line*, [make](https://man.cx/mkdir) a new folder called `sonnets` inside your repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Change directory into the `sonnets` folder and [display its contents](https://man.cx/ls) to verify that the folder is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Using the command line **AND WITHOUT CHANGING DIRECTORIES**, copy the hidden `.gitignore` file from the repo's \"root\" folder into the `sonnets` folder. Remember, you can refer to the \"parent\" folder (up one level) as `..` (two dots).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Display the contents of the directory to verify that the file copied. Use the `-a` option to show all files (including hidden ones like `.gitignore`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the contents of your terminal (from command 1 above on) and save it in a file `practice-session.txt` inside your repo's root directory (not in the `sonnets` folder).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "It's okay if there are extra commands or mistakes in your session log; we'll just be looking that you managed to perform the required steps eventually!\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "`add` and `commit` your shell log, as well as the new `.gitignore` file you created (which will cause the empty `sonnets` folder to be committed as well). `\"Add session recording\"` is a good commit message. We will be looking for a commit for this specific step. You should push this commit to GitHub if you want to keep things backed up."
